***Project Description:***

This is a simple implementation of a 9-choice variation of Rock-Paper-Scissors in Java console. Provided choices in this simulation are: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Glock, Spider-Man, Batman, Wizard, Spock and Lizard. Users will play against the PC until one side has won 5 rounds or the user quits.

***Customization:*** This project is open to slight customization.

- Addition or change of hand gestures: Modify the String array `handChoices` in `HandChoice.java` accordingly to the rules' resulting print-out.
- Change of winning points: Modify the data member `gameBreaker` in `Game.java`, which has been defaulted to 5 for the project's purpose.
